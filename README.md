# Build Internet Computer Projects with Nix

![ci](https://github.com/ninegua/ic-nix/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)
![release](https://github.com/ninegua/ic-nix/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg)

**Usage**

- To build a project, run `nix-build -A <project>`.
- To enter a development environment for a project, run `nix-shell -A <project>.shell`.
- To download the latest pre-built binaries, go to [release page](https://github.com/ninegua/ic-nix/releases/latest).
- To start canister development with latest build, run:
```
nix-shell https://github.com/ninegua/ic-nix/releases/latest/download/dfx-env.tar.gz
```

All you need is a working [nix] installation on your computer.

For aarch64 (Apple M1) architecture, you have a couple choices:

1. Compile everything from source by passing extra argument `--arg force true`.
2. Use `x86_64` binaries by passing extra argument `--argstr system x86_64`.
3. Use pre-built `aarch64` binaries by getting it from the [20230101](https://github.com/ninegua/ic-nix/releases/tag/20230101) release. These were built offline and manually uploaded.

Before you compile from source, you may also want to setup the binary cache (courtesy of [cachix]) by `nix-shell -p cachix --run 'cachix use ninegua'` to avoid unnecessary compilation.

**VSCode/direnv**

Assuming you're developing on `ic`.

1. Make sure you have [`direnv`](https://direnv.net/) installed.
1. Clone this repo next to `ic`.
2. Under `ic/rs`: run `echo "use nix ../../ic-nix/default.nix -A ic.shell" > .envrc`. 
3. In the same directory, run `direnv allow .`

If using VSCode, you should also install the [direnv vscode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mkhl.direnv), to make sure that rust-analyzer will be using the same versions of Rust as your shell.

**WARNING**

Releases are built against the latest main branches of each project on a weekly update schedule. They may not always work. Please understand the risks before proceed.
