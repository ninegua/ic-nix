# Build Internet Computer Projects with Nix

![ci](https://github.com/ninegua/ic-nix/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)
![release](https://github.com/ninegua/ic-nix/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg)

Unofficial build of common binaries used by developers of the [Internet Computer blockchain](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org).

- Directly built from source.
- Cross-platform (Linux and Mac OS X, both `x86_64` and `aarch64`).
- Mostly statically linked with no extra runtime dependency other than libc.
- Weekly release of latest versions at build time.
- Optionally, a standalone SDK environment for nix-shell.

**Usage**

Depending on your objective, you can do any the following:

- To build a project, run `nix-build -A <project>`
- To enter a development environment for a project, run `nix-shell -A <project>.shell`
- To download the latest pre-built binaries, go to [release page](https://github.com/ninegua/ic-nix/releases/latest).
- To start canister SDK development with latest build, run `nix-shell https://github.com/ninegua/ic-nix/releases/latest/download/dfx-env.tar.gz`

All you need is a working [nix] installation on your computer.

**Compile-yourself from source**

For those who prefer to compile from source:
```
nix-shell https://github.com/ninegua/ic-nix/releases/latest/download/dfx-env.tar.gz --arg force true
```

You can use pre-compiled derivations by setting a binary cache (courtesy of [cachix]) `nix-shell -p cachix --run 'cachix use ninegua'`.

**VSCode/direnv**

Assuming you're developing on `ic`.

1. Make sure you have [`direnv`](https://direnv.net/) installed.
1. Clone this repo next to `ic`.
2. Under `ic/rs`: run `echo "use nix ../../ic-nix/default.nix -A ic.shell" > .envrc`. 
3. In the same directory, run `direnv allow .`

If using VSCode, you should also install the [direnv vscode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mkhl.direnv), to make sure that rust-analyzer will be using the same versions of Rust as your shell.

**WARNING**

Releases are built against the latest main branches of each project at the time. They may not always work. Please understand the risks before proceed.

**Supported projects**

 - [ic]
 - [sdk]
 - [motoko]
 - [agent-rs]
 - [candid]
 - [icx-proxy]
 - [cdk-rs]
 - [dfx-extensions]
 - [ic-repl]
 - [ic-wasm]
 - [idl2json]
 - [vessel]

Supported platforms and nixpkgs:

|                  | 23.05  | 23.11  | unstable |
| -------------    | ------ | ------ | -------- |
| darwin x86_64    |    ⍻    |   ❌    |   ❌    |
| linux  x86_64    |   ✅︎    |   ✅︎    |   ✅︎    |
| darwin aarch64   |   ⍻    |   ⍻    |   ✅︎    |

✅︎: builds with no issue\
❌: does not build\
 ⍻: builds but binaries have extra dynamic lib dependency to Nix store

Feature:

- [x] Build native binaries with nix-build with glibc.
- [x] Dynamic binaries with minimal dependencies: glibc on Linux, system libs on OS X.
- [x] Build Wasm binaries with nix-build.
- [x] Develop with nix-shell.
- [x] Build release binaries on Github.
- [ ] Build and run all tests.

Note that this effort requires no nix support of a project unless it already has.
